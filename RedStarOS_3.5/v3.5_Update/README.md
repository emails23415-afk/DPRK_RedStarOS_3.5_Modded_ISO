## What is This?

This is an **unofficial upgrade package** for Red Star OS 3.0 (North Korea's Linux distribution). It upgrades your system from the old 2.6.38 kernel to a modern 5.4 x86_64 kernel, along with updated development tools and system libraries.

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT WARNINGS:**
- This is for educational and research purposes only
- Red Star OS contains surveillance and tracking components
- **Never install on a real computer** - use only in isolated virtual machines
- Disconnect from all networks during installation
- The original OS contains watermarking and monitoring systems

---

## What Does It Do?

This update performs the following upgrades:

### System Components
- **Kernel**: 2.6.38 ‚Üí 5.4.300 x86_64 (with 4.19.325 also available)
- **GCC Compiler**: 4.4.x ‚Üí 6.5.0 / 9.5.0  
- **glibc**: 2.10.x ‚Üí 2.23 / 2.34
- **binutils**: Old version ‚Üí 2.34
- **Python**: Adds Python 3.7.6

### Development Tools
- Updated GNU toolchain (make, autoconf, automake, libtool)
- Cross-compilation support for x86_64
- Modern build tools (CMake 3.12.4, busybox 1.32.1)
- Debugging tools (GDB 7.12 / 8.3)

### Security Improvements
- **Automatic SELinux disabling** (prevents permission errors)
- **Security daemon bypass** (stops `securityd`, `opprc`, `scnprc`)
- **Watermarking prevention** (disables `rtscan` kernel module)
- **Monitoring component removal** (removes autostart surveillance)

---

## Before You Start

###  Requirements

**‚úÖ Essential:**
1. **Red Star OS 3.0** installed in a virtual machine (VirtualBox, VMware, KVM)
2. **Root access** enabled (see "Enabling Root" below)
3. **At least 10GB** free disk space on `/`
4. **At least 2GB RAM** allocated to the VM
5. **All packages** in the `packages/` folder (52 packages included)

**‚úÖ Recommended:**
- Backup your VM before starting
- Disconnect VM from all networks
- Use VPN on host machine
- Snapshot the VM state before installation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Enabling Root Access

Red Star OS disables root by default. You MUST enable it first:

**Method 1: Using rootsetting (Recommended)**
```bash
/usr/sbin/rootsetting
```
This opens a GUI tool. Enter your user password, then set a root password.

**Method 2: From Desktop**
1. Click Applications ‚Üí System ‚Üí Root Terminal
2. Follow the prompts to set root password

**Method 3: If rootsetting doesn't work**
The installer will try to enable root automatically, but may fail due to security restrictions.

### üîç Verifying Root Access

After enabling root, verify it works:
```bash
su - root
# Enter root password
whoami
# Should print: root
```

---

## Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the System

1. **Copy the update folder** to your Desktop:
```bash
# The folder should be at /root/Desktop/v3.5 Update Combo/
```

2. **Open a terminal** (Applications ‚Üí System ‚Üí Terminal)

3. **Navigate to the folder**:
```bash
cd '/root/Desktop/v3.5 Update Combo/'
ls -la
```

You should see:
- `scripts/` folder
- `packages/` folder (with 52 .tar files)
- `Install.desktop` file

### Step 2: Make Scripts Executable

```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

### Step 3: Start the Installation

**Choose ONE of these methods:**

#### Method A: Automatic Installation (Easiest)

Double-click the `Install.desktop` icon on your desktop, or run:

```bash
cd '/root/Desktop/v3.5 Update Combo/scripts/'
sudo ./1.sh
```

The installer will automatically:
- ‚úÖ Check for root privileges
- ‚úÖ Disable SELinux completely
- ‚úÖ Stop all security daemons
- ‚úÖ Create necessary directories
- ‚úÖ Install all packages
- ‚úÖ Build cross-compilation toolchain
- ‚úÖ Compile and install new kernel
- ‚úÖ Prepare system for reboot

#### Method B: Manual Step-by-Step (For Advanced Users)

```bash
# Step 1: Switch to root
su - root

# Step 2: Navigate to scripts
cd '/root/Desktop/v3.5 Update Combo/scripts/'

# Step 3: Source the utilities
source ./pkgutils.sh

# Step 4: Disable security (critical!)
check_root
disable_selinux
disable_security_components

# Step 5: Run installation
./1.sh
```

### Step 4: Monitor Installation

The installation will:
1. Display progress in the terminal
2. Create log files in `logs/` folder
3. Show package compilation progress
4. **Take 2-6 hours** depending on your CPU

**üìä Progress Indicators:**
- "Installing bc" ‚Üí Basic utilities
- "Installing gcc" ‚Üí Compiler (takes longest)  
- "Installing Kernel" ‚Üí Almost done!
- "Press any key in 10 to abort reboot" ‚Üí Success!

### Step 5: Reboot

After Stage 1 completes:
1. System will prompt you to reboot in 10 seconds
2. Press any key to cancel auto-reboot (optional)
3. Reboot manually: `reboot`

After reboot:
1. System should boot with new kernel
2. If a `next.desktop` icon appears, double-click it to continue Stage 2
3. Stage 2 is minimal and completes quickly

### Step 6: Verify Installation

After final reboot:

```bash
# Check kernel version
uname -r
# Should show: 5.4.300 or similar

# Check GCC version
gcc --version
# Should show: gcc (GCC) 6.5.0 or 9.5.0

# Check 64-bit support
uname -m
# Should show: x86_64
```

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Permission denied" when creating /bin/pkgtool

**Symptoms:**
```
ln: creating symbolic link `/bin/pkgtool': Permission denied
```

**Solutions:**
1. **Automatic Fix (Built-in):** The improved installer automatically tries multiple locations. Just continue.

2. **Manual Fix:**
```bash
# Disable SELinux immediately
setenforce 0

# Kill security daemons
killall -9 securityd opprc scnprc artsd

# Verify they're dead
ps aux | grep -E "securityd|opprc|scnprc"
# Should return nothing

# Try installation again
cd '/root/Desktop/v3.5 Update Combo/scripts/'
./1.sh
```

3. **Nuclear Option:**
```bash
# If still failing, use the alternative path
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
ln -sf '/root/Desktop/v3.5 Update Combo/scripts/pkgutils.sh' /usr/local/bin/pkgtool
```

### Problem: System reboots unexpectedly during installation

**Cause:** `securityd` daemon detected file modifications and forced reboot.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Before running installer:
killall -9 securityd opprc scnprc

# Disable the rtscan kernel module
python -c "import fcntl; fcntl.ioctl(open('/dev/res', 'wb'), 29187)"

# Remove autostart files
mv /usr/share/autostart/scnprc.desktop /root/scnprc.desktop.disabled
mv /etc/init/ctguard.conf /root/ctguard.conf.disabled

# Now run installer
cd '/root/Desktop/v3.5 Update Combo/scripts/'
./1.sh
```

### Problem: "Package not found" error

**Symptoms:**
```
ERROR: Package not found: /root/Desktop/v3.5 Update Combo/packages/gcc-6.5.0.tar.xz
```

**Solutions:**
1. Verify package location:
```bash
ls -la '/root/Desktop/v3.5 Update Combo/packages/' | wc -l
# Should show around 52-54 files
```

2. Check folder name (exact spacing matters):
```bash
pwd
# Should be: /root/Desktop/v3.5 Update Combo
```

3. If folder is named differently, either:
   - Rename it to exactly: `v3.5 Update Combo`
   - Or edit scripts to match your folder name

### Problem: Yum fails to install Development Tools

**Symptoms:**
```
yum install @"Development Tools" failed
```

**Solution:** This is **non-critical**. The installer includes these tools in packages and will continue anyway.

If you want to fix it:
```bash
# Mount the Red Star OS installation ISO
mount /dev/cdrom /media

# Try yum again
yum --disablerepo=* --enablerepo=c6-media install @"Development Tools"
```

### Problem: Compilation fails with "out of memory"

**Cause:** VM has insufficient RAM (gcc compilation is memory-intensive).

**Solution:**
1. Increase VM RAM to at least 2GB (4GB recommended)
2. Add swap space:
```bash
dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1M count=2048
chmod 600 /swapfile
mkswap /swapfile
swapon /swapfile
```

### Problem: Installation hangs at "Compiling"

**Symptom:** Package compilation appears frozen.

**What's happening:** Large packages (gcc, kernel) take 30-120 minutes to compile.

**Solution:**
1. **Be patient!** Open another terminal and check:
```bash
top
# Look for 'make' or 'gcc' processes using CPU
```

2. Check log files:
```bash
tail -f /root/Desktop/v3.5\ Update\ Combo/logs/installation.log
```

3. If truly hung (no CPU activity for 10+ minutes):
```bash
killall make
cd '/root/Desktop/v3.5 Update Combo/scripts/'
./1.sh  # Restart installation
```

### Problem: SELinux re-enables after reboot

**Symptom:** After reboot, `getenforce` shows "Enforcing"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check GRUB configuration
grep "selinux=0" /boot/grub/grub.conf

# If not present, add it manually:
vi /boot/grub/grub.conf

# Find the kernel line (looks like):
# kernel /vmlinuz-... root=...

# Add selinux=0 to the end:
# kernel /vmlinuz-... root=... selinux=0

# Save and reboot
```

### Problem: Can't find log files

**Location:** All logs are in:
```bash
/root/Desktop/v3.5\ Update\ Combo/logs/
```

**Key log files:**
- `installation.log` - Main installation log
- `yum_install.log` - Yum package installation  
- `extract_*.log` - Individual package extraction
- `Stage1.txt` - Complete Stage 1 output
- `Stage2.txt` - Complete Stage 2 output

**View logs:**
```bash
cd '/root/Desktop/v3.5 Update Combo/logs/'
less installation.log
# Press 'q' to quit
```

## Technical Details

### What Gets Modified

**System Directories:**
- `/usr/bin`, `/usr/lib`, `/usr/include` - Updated system tools
- `/usr/src/kernels/` - New kernel source
- `/boot/` - New kernel image and initrd
- `/opt/Cross64/` - Cross-compilation toolchain
- `/opt/NewRoot/` - Isolated build environment
- `/workspace/` - Temporary build directory

**Configuration Files:**
- `/boot/grub/grub.conf` - Adds `selinux=0` parameter
- `/etc/selinux/config` - Sets SELINUX=disabled
- `~/.bashrc` - Adds `pkgtool` alias (fallback)

**Backups:**
All modified config files are backed up to:
```
/root/Desktop/v3.5 Update Combo/backup/
```

### Security Components Disabled

The installer disables these Red Star OS surveillance components:

| Component | Purpose | Disable Method |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **SELinux** | File access control | `setenforce 0` + grub parameter |
| **securityd** | File integrity monitor | `killall -9 securityd` |
| **opprc** | Media watermarking daemon | `killall -9 opprc` |
| **scnprc** | Antivirus/scanner | `killall -9 scnprc` |
| **rtscan** | Kernel protection module | Python ioctl disable |
| **libos.so** | OS validation library | Replaced with defused version |
| **ctguard** | System monitor | Autostart removed |

**What This Means:**
- You can modify system files without forced reboots
- Media files won't be watermarked with your serial number
- System won't report activities to monitoring services
- SELinux won't block legitimate operations

**Note:** These are North Korean surveillance systems. Disabling them is necessary for the update to work, but also demonstrates why Red Star OS should never be used outside isolated VMs.

## FAQ

**Q: Why does this exist?**  
A: Red Star OS is an interesting curiosity for security researchers. This update makes it more usable for analysis and brings it closer to modern Linux standards.

**Q: Is this safe to use?**  
A: Only in an isolated VM with no network access. Red Star OS is surveillance software. This update removes some monitoring but cannot guarantee all tracking is disabled.

**Q: Will this remove all surveillance?**  
A: No. It removes known components (securityd, opprc, watermarking), but unknown backdoors may exist. **Never trust Red Star OS** with real data.

**Q: Can I use this on Red Star OS 2.0?**  
A: No, this is specifically for version 3.0. Version 2.0 has a different architecture.

**Q: Why does compilation take so long?**  
A: GCC and the kernel are huge projects (millions of lines of code). A full GCC compilation takes 1-2 hours even on modern CPUs.

**Q: Can I stop and resume later?**  
A: No. The installation must complete in one run. If it fails, you'll need to restart from the beginning (or at least from a clean workspace).

**Q: What if I encounter errors?**  
A: Check the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section. Most errors are due to:
1. SELinux/security daemons still running
2. Insufficient RAM/disk space
3. Incorrect folder paths

**Q: Can I contribute improvements?**  
A: Yes! This project is open for improvements. See the Credits section for the original sources.

**Q: Why x86_64 and not ARM or other architectures?**  
A: Red Star OS 3.0 is primarily x86-based. The cross-compilation setup targets x86_64 to modernize while maintaining compatibility.

**Q: Will this break my existing Red Star OS?**  
A: Potentially yes. That's why you should:
1. Only use in a VM
2. Take a snapshot before starting
3. Backup any data (though there shouldn't be any real data in Red Star OS)
