# RedStarOS 3.5 Update - Quick Start Guide

## TL;DR - Just Get It Running!

```bash
# Step 1: Enable root access
/usr/sbin/rootsetting

# Step 2: Navigate to update directory
cd "/root/Desktop/v3.5 Update Combo"

# Step 3: Run resilient installer
./install_resilient.sh

# That's it! ‚úì
```

## What This Does

The resilient installer automatically:
1. ‚úì Disables SELinux
2. ‚úì Kills security daemons (securityd, opprc, scnprc)
3. ‚úì Disables rtscan kernel module
4. ‚úì Makes system directories writable
5. ‚úì Creates necessary shortcuts with multiple fallback methods
6. ‚úì Backs up important configuration files
7. ‚úì Runs pre-flight system checks
8. ‚úì Launches the installation process

## Before You Start

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT
- **Backup your data** (just in case)
- Have **at least 10GB free space**
- **Disconnect from network** (recommended)
- **Ensure stable power** (use UPS if available)

## Common Issues - Quick Fixes

### "Permission denied" error?
```bash
setenforce 0
killall -9 securityd
./install_resilient.sh
```

### System keeps rebooting?
```bash
killall -9 securityd opprc scnprc
python -c "import fcntl; fcntl.ioctl(open('/dev/res', 'wb'), 29187)"
./install_resilient.sh
```

### Can't find files?
```bash
# Check if you're in the right directory
pwd
ls -la packages/
# Should show many .tar.* files
```

## Alternative: Manual Control

If you want more control over the process:

```bash
# Step 1: Run pre-flight checks only
./scripts/preflight_check.sh

# Step 2: Review logs
cat logs/preflight.log

# Step 3: Run installation
./scripts/1_improved.sh
```

## During Installation

- **Don't interrupt** the process
- **Don't close** the terminal
- System will **reboot several times** (this is normal)
- Installation takes **30-60 minutes** depending on your hardware

## After Installation

The system will automatically:
1. Upgrade kernel to 5.4 x86_64
2. Update critical system components
3. Install development tools
4. Set up cross-compilation environment
5. Reboot when needed

## Need Help?

1. **Check logs**: `cat logs/master.log`
2. **Read full README**: `cat README_IMPROVED.md`
3. **Join Discord**: discord.gg/MY68R2Quq5

## Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when you see:
```
‚úì Root privileges confirmed
‚úì SELinux disabled
‚úì Security components stopped
‚úì System directories accessible
```

## Pro Tips

üí° **Set automatic login** in System Preferences to reduce password prompts during reboots

üí° **Keep terminal visible** to monitor progress

üí° **Don't panic** if you see lots of output - that's normal!
